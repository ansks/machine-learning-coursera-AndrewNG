# machine-learning-coursera-AndrewNG

## This contains all the course work done for Machine Learning course offered by Coursera in collaboration with Stanford University. 

### In this course material, you will find following algorithms coded in Matlab:

### Supervised Learning: 
	1. Linear Regression 
	2. Multivariate Linear Regression 
	3. Logistic Regression 
	4. Neural Network - Basics
	5. Support Vector Machines

### Unsupervised Learning: 
	6. K-Means Clustering 
	7. Dimensionality Reduction - Principal Components Analysis
	8. Anomaly Detection - using Gaussian Distribution 


	9. Recommender Systems 

etc..

## All the exercises are done in Matlab/Octave.
